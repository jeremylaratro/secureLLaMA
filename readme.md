# Airgapped AI for Enhanced Data Security
> This project has been created as a part of my masters degree in cybersecurity. The project aims to create a simple, effective solution for countering the massive data privacy issues associated with the AIaaS model. It does this by simplifying the process for locally managed, private AI - executing Meta's Llama model directly with Torchrun, using Gradio for a locally hosted web server, and includes several host and container-hardening scripts to streamline deployment.
